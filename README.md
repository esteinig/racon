# Racon Fork 

This is a fork for `racon` to build a `conda` package for use with `Unicycler` in Python 3. I have simply converted the Python scripts available in the repository to Python 3 - this does likely not include full functionality across `racon` but seems to be able to run the polishing step in `Unicycler`.

You can install the `racon` package in `conda` via:

`conda install -c esteinig racon`
